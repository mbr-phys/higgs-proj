\section{Replicating results}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Here are my plots for replicating what we did in first term:
        \begin{figure}[H]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{leps_plot.png}
            \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{bsgamma_plot.png}
            \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{bmix_old.png}
            \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{bmix_plot.png}
            \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{comb1_plot.png}
        \end{figure}
    \item Like Oliver, the main difference seems to be with $b\to s\gamma$ where it fits higher than before -- \textbf{the combined fit yields $m_{H^+}\gtrsim890\,$GeV at $2\sigma$ compared to $m_{H^+}\gtrsim\,500$GeV in my previous fits}
    \item \textit{Note: all the plots here are showing contours for $1,2\sigma$}
    \item This is using the higher order $b\to s\gamma$ expressions from \href{https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.10440}{Crivellin 1903.10440}
    \item I have modified the SM value in flavio for $b\to s\gamma$ to fit the current result of $(3.40\pm0.17)e^{-4}$ 
    \item It seems like it could be down to how flavio fits, but we would need to confirm this 
    \item I have also included the fit for B mixing from higher-order expressions in \href{https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.10440}{Crivellin 1903.10440} to show the difference -- the gap we find around $m_{H^+}\sim m_t(m_t)$ is due to divergences in the loop functions for this value
    \item Adding in $B_{s,d}\to\mu\mu$ and $\mathcal{R}(D^{(*)})$ yields similar results to what I had before
        \begin{figure}[H]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{rd_both.png}
        \end{figure}
    \item $\mathcal{R}(D)$ and $\mathcal{R}(D^*)$ are fitting simultaneously it seems right now, which wasn't what we had before, so looking at individual plots:
        \begin{figure}[H]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{rd_plot.png}
            \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{rdst_plot.png}
        \end{figure}
    \item It appears that both of them do fit individually which is not what we had before -- I'm not quite sure why this is the case currently
    \item For $B_{s,d}\to\mu\mu$, the left diagram is approximating $m_{H^+}\sim m_{H^0}$ which is the rough limit James has from the obliques, and the right diagram is fixing $m_{H^0}=1500\,$GeV
    \item Using the convention from 1903.10440 for the trilinear couplings means that instead of using $M=m_{12}/(\sin\beta\cos\beta)$ as I did previously, you use $\lambda_3$ from the 2HDM potential
    \item The two trilinear couplings we have to consider are
        \begin{align*}
            \lambda_{h^0 H^+ H^-} &= v\sin(\beta-\alpha)\lambda_3, &
            \lambda_{H^0 H^+ H^-} &= v\cos(\beta-\alpha)\lambda_3 
        \end{align*}
    \item In the alignment limit which I have been using so far for these, $\sin(\beta-\alpha)=1$, so we only have to consider $\lambda_{h^0 H^+ H^-}$ 
    \item Using the updated values from Y Amhis at ICHEP 2020 and some code updates:
        \begin{figure}[H]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{bmumu_apx.png}
            \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{bmumu_fix.png}
        \end{figure}
    \item These seem to preserve the overall shapes of the plots, but shifts constraints towards higher $\tan\beta$
    \item Updated global fits incoming to see the change there
    \item The contributions from the trilinear coupling seems to be minimal anyway, varying $\lambda_3$ from $0.01\to2$ doesn't change the results to any noticeable level, so for now I have set $\lambda_3=0.1$
    \item The coupling only contributes to $C_S$ and $C_P$ operators so far which only impact $B\to\mu\mu$
    \item Checking the combined fit for all these observables to compare to my overall project work (bar the inclusion of James' obliques):
        \begin{figure}[H]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{comb2_apx.png}
            \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{comb2_fix.png}
        \end{figure}
    \item Left is approximating $m_{H^+}\sim m_{H^0}$ as above for $B\to\mu\mu$ (can't compare to project directly as didn't use this limit); right is fixing $m_{H^0}=1500\,$GeV
    \item For the left, we have $m_{H^+}\gtrsim890\,$GeV, $\tan\beta\gtrsim3.4$
    \item For the right, we have $m_{H^+}\gtrsim890\,$GeV, $\tan\beta\lesssim35$; in my project for this, I had $m_{H^+}\gtrsim500\,$GeV and $\tan\beta\lesssim21$
    \item Interestingly, these new plots are beginning to look more similar to my very early work using $B\to\mu\mu$ in the large $\tan\beta$ limit
    \item Below are the old plots for comparison to the above
    \item The constraints on $m_{H^+}$ have not changed at all since this primarily comes from $b\to s\gamma$, but the constraints on $\tan\beta$ have been significantly shifted to the right
        \begin{figure}[H]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{comb2_apx_old.png}
            \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{comb2_fix_old.png}
        \end{figure}
\end{itemize}

\section{New Observables and To Do}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Also started looking at the tree-level semileptonic decays 
    \item For semileptonics and leptonics, I think the WC contributions work out the same, e.g. for $b\to u\mu\nu_\mu$ (using the subscript convention from \href{https://wcxf.github.io/assets/pdf/WET.flavio.pdf}{flavio's WET basis})
        \begin{align*}
            \mathcal{O}_{SR} = -\frac{4G_F}{\sqrt{2}}V_{ub}(\bar{u}_Lb_R)(\bar{\mu}_R\nu_{\mu L}) &\to C_{SR} = \frac{m_u}{m_{H^+}^2} \\
            \mathcal{O}_{SL} = -\frac{4G_F}{\sqrt{2}}V_{ub}(\bar{u}_Rb_L)(\bar{\mu}_L\nu_{\mu R}) &\to C_{SL} = \frac{m_b\tan^2\beta}{m_{H^+}^2} 
        \end{align*}
    \item For the tree-level leptonics, this transforms to $r_H$ from \href{https://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.5135.pdf}{0907.5135}, and looks to give the right results for semileptonics (including being used for the $\mathcal{R}(D)$s above) 
    \item So providing the SM calculations for the semileptonics are fine, it's quite simple to fit these too:
        \begin{figure}[H]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{sls_plot.png}
        \end{figure}
    \item The next thing is to look at $R_K$ and $R_{K^{*0}}$ 
    \item From \href{https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.05340.pdf}{1704.05340}, the operators needed for the $R_K$s are $C_7,C_7',C_9,C_9',C_{10},C_{10}'$ for both $bs\mu\mu$ and $bsee$ -- I think we also need to consider $C_8,C_8'$ so these are also calculated and included in my fits 
    \item All these can be taken from \href{https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.10440.pdf}{1903.10440} -- the only new WCs are $C_9,C_9'$ as the others are included in $b\to s\gamma$ and $B\to\mu\mu$
    \item So far, we get essentially no constraint in our parameter space from $R_K$ and $R_{K^{*0}}$:
        \begin{figure}[H]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{rks_plot.png}
        \end{figure}
    \item There still needs to be more checks in case I've missed something, but so far we see a small region excluded at $1\sigma$ in the left of the plot and that's it
    \item I want to check in literature for the $R_K$s in 2HDM Type II to see if there's any fits that include these to see what results have been found historically to give some at least a rough idea of what should be expected
    \item I have looked at the fit for the $R_K$s in \href{https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.11942.pdf}{2007.11942} and it's not the easiest to compare to, but it looks like they've found only a small constraint from $R_K$s near what would be along the left axis of our plots, which is roughly similar to where we're beginning to see a constraint here
    \item I need to do the fits including $B\to\mu\mu$ in the wrong sign limit too and compare to my previous results
\end{itemize}
